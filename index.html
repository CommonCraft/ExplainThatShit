  text[8] = "Don't assume people know what you know. They don't know that shit.  Give them a way to catch up quickly.";
  text[9] = "Impress experts not with your depth of knowledge, but how broadly you can apply that shit.";

  text[39] = "Start building explanation skills by learning to explain what the hell you do for a living and why that shit matters.";
  text[40] = "A question any explanation should answer 'why' - as in, why does this shit make sense? Or why am I so good looking?";
  text[41] = "Like a movie script, a written explanation can be a starting point for some serious multi-media shit.";
  text[42] = "Sometimes the big thing keeping shit from being adopted isn't features, value or design, but explanation.";

  text[44] = "Slow the hell down. Take deep breaths. Add emphasis by saying important...shit...slowly.";
  text[45] = "Visuals and media can make your explanation shine. Experiment with ways to blow peoples' minds.";
  text[46] = "In presenting an explanation, simple drawings can do the trick. You don't have to be Da Vinci or Bob Ross.";

  text[50] = "The only prerequisite for explanation is understanding the shit you're spewing. Take the time to learn the facts, then get creative. ";
  text[51] = "Einstein once said 'If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.' That's some smart shit right there.";
  text[51] = "Explanations are like driving directions. Image what it's like to approach some shit for the FIRST time.";
  text[52] = "In the future, companies will compete on who can explain their shit the best. You can help."
  text[53] = "Don't let your best explanations disappear into the ether. Record that shit and it may live forever."
